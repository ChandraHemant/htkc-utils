# Dynamic Search Function for Laravel: Handle Nested Relationships and Complex Queries

## Overview
Introducing a powerful and flexible dynamic search function for Laravel applications, designed to simplify complex queries with nested and recursive relationship conditions. This package provides an elegant solution to dynamically search across multiple models and their related data, offering developers the ability to handle various levels of relationships in a single, streamlined query.

## Class Overview

##### Namespace: ChandraHemant\DynamicSearch
##### Author: Hemant Kumar Chandra

## Features
* Dynamic Model and Resource Handling: Pass the model name and resource class directly through the API request, enabling easy and dynamic querying across different models.
* Search Multiple Columns: Search across multiple columns within a model or its related models by simply specifying the columns in the API request.
* Nested and Recursive Relationships: The function supports nested relationships, allowing you to search deep within related models and their sub-relations.
* Flexible and Extendable: Easily extend or modify the functionality to fit your specific application's needs, making it a versatile tool for any Laravel project.
* Secure and Validated: Built-in validation ensures that only valid models and resources are processed, reducing the risk of errors and improving application security.

## Usage Example
Hereâ€™s an example API request to demonstrate how the function works:

```json
{
    "model": "Customer",
    "resource": "CustomerResource",
    "column": ["name", "phone", "email", "orders.product.category.name"],
    "value": "Electronics"
}
```

In this example, the function will:
* Search within the Customer model for matches in the name, phone, or email fields.
* Traverse the orders relationship to the product model, then further into the category model to search for matches in the name field.

## Installation

You can easily add this functionality to your Laravel project by installing the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require chandra-hemant/htkc-utils
```

# DynamicSearchHelper Class

The `DynamicSearchHelper` class provides a set of methods for retrieving and manipulating data from a database table, especially tailored for use with Laravel's Eloquent ORM. This guide outlines how to effectively utilize these methods to implement dynamic search functionality.

## Usage

### Retrieving Data

You can retrieve data from your database table using the `getDynamicSearchData` method.

```php

use Illuminate\Http\Request; // Import your Eloquent model

 $searchColumns = [
    // Specify your searchable columns here
 ];

$helper = new DynamicSearchHelper(
    request: $request,
    searchColumns: $searchColumns,
    withPagination: true,
    queryMode: false,
    isApi: true
);

$result = $helper->getDynamicSearchData();
```

### Search Functionality

You can enable search functionality by providing columns and relationships to search in.

```php
// Define search value, columns, and relationships
$searchColumns = ['column1','relationshipMethod.column2','relationshipMethod1.relationshipMethod2.column3','relationshipMethod3.relationshipMethod4.relationshipMethod5.relationshipMethod6.column8'];
```

### Pagination

Pagination is applied automatically based on the request parameters.


## Constructor Parameters

* `$request` (Illuminate\Http\Request).
* `$searchColumns` (array): An array specifying columns to search in.
* `$withPagination` (bool): Specifying paginate data or not.
* `$queryMode` (bool): Specifying data from the provided Eloquent model.
* `$isApi` (bool): Specifying data format.

## Methods

`getDynamicSearchData(): Illuminate\Support\Collection`
Retrieve dynamic search data from the provided Eloquent model.


### Example

Here's an example of how you can utilize these methods in your controller:

```php
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use ChandraHemant\HtkcUtils\DynamicSearchHelper;

class YourController extends Controller
{
    public function index(Request $request)
    {

        $user = Auth::user();

        $helper = new DynamicSearchHelper(
            request: $request,
            searchColumns: ['unique_id' => $user->unique_id],  // Provide your search columns if needed
            withPagination: true,
            queryMode: false,
            isApi: false,
        );
    
        // Get the dynamic search data
        $data = $helper->getDynamicSearchData();

        return view('your_view', compact('data'));
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

This guide provides a basic overview of how to use the `DynamicSearchHelper` class in your Laravel application. By following these instructions, you can easily implement dynamic search functionality.


## How to Use

1. *Installation*: Ensure that the DataTableHelper class is included in your Laravel project.
2. *Initialization*: Create an instance of the DataTableHelper class.
3. *Data Retrieval*: Call the `getDynamicSearchData` method with specified columns, relationship columns, and other parameters to retrieve custom paginated and filtered data.
5. *Customization*: Adjust the class according to your specific use case by modifying the methods or extending its functionality.

By leveraging the `DataTableHelper` class, you can seamlessly integrate dynamic search functionality into your Laravel application, providing a user-friendly and efficient way to handle large datasets in tabular form.

#### Note: 
Maintaining consistency between the searchColumns array and the actual columns in your model and its relationships is crucial for accurate search results in the DynamicSearchHelper class.

The `searchColumns` array specifies the fields and relationships to be searched within your models. Each element should correspond directly to the columns and relationships defined in your Eloquent models. For instance, if you specify `['orders.product.category.name']` in the `searchColumns`, it assumes that your model has the appropriate relationships `(orders, product, category)` set up correctly and that each relationship has the `name` field available for searching.

To ensure that the dynamic search functionality works seamlessly, double-check that:

* The column names and relationship methods used in `searchColumns` match those defined in your Eloquent models.
* Relationships are correctly defined in your models and are accessible for querying.
* The search functionality aligns with the structure and naming conventions of your database schema.

Inconsistent or incorrect `searchColumns` values may lead to unexpected results or errors, as the helper class will attempt to search across columns and relationships that may not exist or be properly defined.
